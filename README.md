## 🌐 **Computer Networks**

A **computer network** is a system where two or more computers (or devices) are connected together to **share data, resources, and communication**.

* It can connect devices locally (LAN) or worldwide (Internet).
* Networks use hardware (cables, routers, switches) and software (protocols like TCP/IP) to transfer information.
* They allow **file sharing, internet access, email, video calls, online banking, cloud storage**, and much more.

> In short → **Computer Networks connect devices to make communication and resource sharing faster, easier, and more reliable.**
