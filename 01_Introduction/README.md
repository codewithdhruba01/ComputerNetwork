# **What Is a Computer Network?**

Computer Network is an interconnection of numerous computers to share an **operating system, hardware, and information** through a transmission mode between them. There is no restriction to the area between two computers in a network.

A computer network involves the following elements:

## **Nodes (Workstations)**

The multiple terminals connected to the network sharing the network resources are known as nodes.

### **1. Server**

We assign a specific node as a main or central node at a well-known and permanent address to support the network.
The node offering the service is called the **server**.

### **2. Network Interface Unit**

The interpreter, which connects the server and multiple nodes, is known as the **Network Interface Unit (NIU)**.
The network interface unit is linked to the server and all workstations to keep up the connection.

# **Elements of a Computer Network**

The computer network involves the following networking elements:

### **1. Sender**

The computer that wants to give a message to some mainframe or other computers.

### **2. Receiver**

The computer that takes the data from the sender who wishes to communicate.

### **3. Communication Medium**

It is the medium over which the sender connects to the receiver.
It may be wired if the distance is less or wireless if the distance is much more.

### **4. Protocols**

It is a set of rules which the sender and receiver will follow.

# **Types of Computer Networks**

The following are the **types of computer networks**:

* **Personal Area Network (PAN):**
  A small network used for communication between personal devices like phones, laptops, and tablets.

* **Local Area Network (LAN):**
  A network that connects computers within a small area, such as a home, office, or building.

* **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):**
  A LAN that uses wireless technology (Wi-Fi) to connect devices.

* **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):**
  A network that spans a city or a large campus, connecting multiple LANs.

* **Wide Area Network (WAN):**
  A network that covers a large geographical area, often connecting multiple MANs or LANs.

* **Campus Area Network (CAN):**
  A network that connects multiple LANs within a limited area, such as a university or corporate campus.

* **Storage Area Network (SAN):**
  A high-speed network that provides access to consolidated storage devices.

* **System Area Network:**
  A network used to connect high-performance computers in a data center or cluster.

* **Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN):**
  A point-to-multipoint LAN architecture using fiber optics to reduce costs and infrastructure.

* **Enterprise Private Network (EPN):**
  A private network used by businesses to securely connect their multiple locations.

* **Virtual Private Network (VPN):**
  A secure network that uses the internet to connect remote users to a private network.

## **1. Resource Sharing**

* Network ka main purpose → **resource share karna**.
* Ek computer ke programs, data, printer, storage dusre computers use kar sakte hain.
* **Load sharing**: Ek bada kaam network ke multiple computers me divide hokar fast ho jata hai.

## **2. Simultaneous Access**

* Multiple users **ek hi file/data ko ek saath** access aur update kar sakte hain.
* Data usually **file server** me store hota hai.
* Ek user agar file change karta hai → sabko latest version milega.

## **3. High Reliability**

* Important data **multiple computers** me stored hota hai.
* Agar ek computer fail ho jaye → data dusre computer se recover ho jata hai.
* Network makes data **secure and reliable**.

## **4. Cost Reduction**

* Devices share hone se **cost kam hoti hai**.
* Chote computers (microcomputers) cheap hote hain but performance acchi dete hain.
* Network se resources buy karna kaafi **cost-effective** hota hai.

## **5. Communication Medium**

* Network long-distance communication ko easy banata hai.
* Do ya zyada log ek project par milkar kaam kar sakte hain.

## Uses of Computer Networks (Most Important)

## **1. Access to Remote Information**

Examples:

* Online shopping, bill payment, e-banking
* Internet se information: news, sports, science, government info
* Online newspaper reading

## **2. Person-to-Person Communication**

### **E-mail**

Steps:

1. User message likhta hai
2. Server me store hota hai
3. Server receiver ko alert karta hai
4. Receiver message read karta hai

### **Teleconferencing / Videoconferencing**

* Log typing se online meeting karte hain.
* Video conferencing me face-to-face baat bhi possible hoti hai.

## **3. Worldwide Newsgroups**

* Ek person information post karta hai
* Others feedback/comment de sakte hain

## **4. Interactive Entertainment**

* **Video on demand:** Online movies dekh sakte ho
* **Online gaming:** Multi-player real-time games
* Quiz, contest, discussion type live programs me participate karna
