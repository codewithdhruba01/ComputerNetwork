# **What Is a Computer Network?**

Computer Network is an interconnection of numerous computers to share an **operating system, hardware, and information** through a transmission mode between them. There is no restriction to the area between two computers in a network.

A computer network involves the following elements:

## **Nodes (Workstations)**

The multiple terminals connected to the network sharing the network resources are known as nodes.

### **1. Server**

We assign a specific node as a main or central node at a well-known and permanent address to support the network.
The node offering the service is called the **server**.

### **2. Network Interface Unit**

The interpreter, which connects the server and multiple nodes, is known as the **Network Interface Unit (NIU)**.
The network interface unit is linked to the server and all workstations to keep up the connection.

# **Elements of a Computer Network**

The computer network involves the following networking elements:

### **1. Sender**

Number of systems connected in LAN may vary from **2 to 16 million**.

LAN provides an easy way of sharing resources between end users.
Resources include:

* printers
* file servers
* scanners
* internet

LANs are composed of inexpensive networking and routing equipment.
It may include **local servers** for file storage and shared applications.

LAN operates on **private IP addresses** and does not involve heavy routing.
It works under its own local domain and is controlled centrally.

LAN uses either:

* **Ethernet (Star topology)**
* **Token-ring technology** (rarely used)

LAN can be **wired**, **wireless**, or **both**.


# **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands **throughout a city**, such as a cable TV network.

Technology used:

* Ethernet
* Token-ring
* ATM
* FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)

**Metro Ethernet** is a MAN service provided by ISPs to help organizations expand their LANs across a city.
For example, MAN can connect all branch offices of a company within a city.

The backbone of MAN is **high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics**.

MAN works between:

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

MAN provides uplink for LANs to WAN or internet.


# **Wide Area Network (WAN)**

The Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a **large geographical area**, possibly across provinces or entire countries.

Telecommunication networks are examples of WANs.
WAN provides connectivity to **MANs and LANs**.

WAN uses **very high-speed backbone** and therefore requires expensive network equipment.

Advanced WAN technologies include:

* ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
* Frame Relay
* SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)

WAN may be managed by **multiple administrators**.


# **Internetwork**

A network of networks is called an **internetwork**, or simply the **internet**.
It is the **largest network** on the planet.

The internet connects all WANs and can connect LANs and home networks.

Internet uses:

* **TCP/IP protocol suite**
* **IP addresses** for identification

# **Ethernet**
Ethernet is the **most common technology** used in a LAN (Local Area Network).
It connects computers through a switch or hub.

### **Important Points:**

* Invented in the 1970s, standard: **IEEE 802.3**
* Ethernet uses shared media → **data collisions can happen**
* To detect collisions, it uses **CSMA/CD**
* Every Ethernet device has a **48-bit MAC address** (unique identity)
* Traditional Ethernet speed → **10 Mbps** (10BASE-T)
* Cables used: **Coaxial or Cat-5 with RJ-45 connector**
* Topology: **Star topology**
* Max cable length: **100 meters**

# **Fast Ethernet**
Fast Ethernet is a **faster version** of normal Ethernet.

### **Important Points:**

* Speed: **100 Mbps**
* Standard: **100BASE-T**
* Works on **Cat-5 cable**
* Wireless Fast Ethernet uses **CSMA/CA**
* Fiber version: **100BASE-FX**
* Fiber cable range:

  * **100 m** (half-duplex)
  * **2000 m** (full-duplex)


# **Gigabit Ethernet**
Gigabit Ethernet is an **even faster** type of Ethernet.

### **Important Points:**

* Speed: **1000 Mbps = 1 Gbps**
* Introduced after 1995
* Uses **Cat-5, Cat-5e, Cat-6 cables**
* Standard: **IEEE 802.3ab**
* Fiber version: **IEEE 802.3ah**

Most modern networks use Gigabit Ethernet because it is very fast.

# **Virtual LAN (VLAN)**
In a normal Ethernet network:

* There is **one broadcast domain** (everyone receives broadcast messages)
* There is **one collision domain**

Switches can separate collision domains,
but **broadcast domain remains the same**.

### **What does VLAN do?**
VLAN divides a single network into **multiple small networks (groups)** inside the same switch.

### **Example:**

In a switch with 10 computers:

* 5 computers → VLAN 10
* 5 computers → VLAN 20

Now:

* Computers in VLAN 10 can talk only to each other
* Computers in VLAN 20 can talk only to each other
* A device in one VLAN **cannot communicate** with another VLAN directly

### **Important:**

* VLAN is a **Layer-2 technology**
* To communicate between two VLANs, a **Router (Layer-3 device)** is required


## **Networking Engineering**
Networking engineering is a complicated task that involves software, firmware, chip-level engineering, hardware, and electric pulses.
To make networking easier, the whole networking concept is divided into **multiple layers**.

Each layer performs a specific task and is independent from other layers.
But almost all networking tasks depend on all layers collectively.
Layers share data with each other and depend on each other to take input and send output.

## **Layered Tasks**
In a layered network model, the whole networking process is divided into **small tasks**.
Each task is assigned to a particular layer, and each layer works **dedicatedly** on its own work.

In layered communication:
* One layer of a device communicates with the **same layer** on another device (peer-to-peer communication).
* The task can start from the top layer or bottom layer.
* If the task starts at the top, it goes down layer by layer.
* If it starts at the bottom, it travels upward.

Each layer has its own protocols, procedures, and functions.
Layers identify their counterparts using **encapsulation headers and tails**.


## **OSI Model**
OSI (Open System Interconnect) model is an **open standard** for all communication systems.
It was developed by the **International Standard Organization (ISO)**.

The OSI model has **seven layers**:

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Presentation Layer**
3. **Session Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Network Layer**
6. **Data Link Layer**
7. **Physical Layer**


### **Application Layer**
Provides interface to the user through protocols that interact directly with applications.

### **Presentation Layer**
Defines how data from the remote host should be presented in the native format.

### **Session Layer**
Maintains communication sessions between hosts.
Example: After login, the session remains active for some time without re-authentication.

### **Transport Layer**
Provides **end-to-end delivery** between hosts.

### **Network Layer**

Responsible for **address assignment** and uniquely identifying hosts in the network.

### **Data Link Layer**
Handles reading and writing data on the physical line. Detects **link-level errors**.

### **Physical Layer**
Defines the hardware, cabling, data pulses, power output, etc.

# **Internet Model (TCP/IP Model)**

Internet uses the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, also called the **Internet Model**.
It has **4 layers** and is used for all communication over the internet.

Unlike OSI, the Internet Model depends on network independence.

Its layers are:

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Transport Layer**
3. **Internet Layer**
4. **Link Layer**

### **Application Layer**
Defines protocols that allow users to interact with the network.
Examples: **FTP, HTTP**

### **Transport Layer**

Defines how data should flow between hosts. Main protocol: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
Ensures:

* Ordered delivery
* Reliable transfer
* End-to-end communication

### **Internet Layer**

Uses **Internet Protocol (IP)** for addressing and routing.
Identifies hosts and finds best path for data.

### **Link Layer**

Handles sending and receiving actual data frames.
Independent of hardware and network architecture.
