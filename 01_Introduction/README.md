# **What Is a Computer Network?**

Computer Network is an interconnection of numerous computers to share an **operating system, hardware, and information** through a transmission mode between them. There is no restriction to the area between two computers in a network.

A computer network involves the following elements:

## **Nodes (Workstations)**

The multiple terminals connected to the network sharing the network resources are known as nodes.

### **1. Server**

We assign a specific node as a main or central node at a well-known and permanent address to support the network.
The node offering the service is called the **server**.

### **2. Network Interface Unit**

The interpreter, which connects the server and multiple nodes, is known as the **Network Interface Unit (NIU)**.
The network interface unit is linked to the server and all workstations to keep up the connection.

# **Elements of a Computer Network**

The computer network involves the following networking elements:

### **1. Sender**

# **Local Area Network (LAN)**

A computer network spanned **inside a building** and operated under a single administrative system is termed as a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.
Usually, LAN covers:

* office buildings
* schools
* colleges
* universities

Number of systems connected in LAN may vary from **2 to 16 million**.

LAN provides an easy way of sharing resources between end users.
Resources include:

* printers
* file servers
* scanners
* internet

LANs are composed of inexpensive networking and routing equipment.
It may include **local servers** for file storage and shared applications.

LAN operates on **private IP addresses** and does not involve heavy routing.
It works under its own local domain and is controlled centrally.

LAN uses either:

* **Ethernet (Star topology)**
* **Token-ring technology** (rarely used)

LAN can be **wired**, **wireless**, or **both**.


# **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands **throughout a city**, such as a cable TV network.

Technology used:

* Ethernet
* Token-ring
* ATM
* FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)

**Metro Ethernet** is a MAN service provided by ISPs to help organizations expand their LANs across a city.
For example, MAN can connect all branch offices of a company within a city.

The backbone of MAN is **high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics**.

MAN works between:

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

MAN provides uplink for LANs to WAN or internet.


# **Wide Area Network (WAN)**

The Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a **large geographical area**, possibly across provinces or entire countries.

Telecommunication networks are examples of WANs.
WAN provides connectivity to **MANs and LANs**.

WAN uses **very high-speed backbone** and therefore requires expensive network equipment.

Advanced WAN technologies include:

* ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
* Frame Relay
* SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)

WAN may be managed by **multiple administrators**.


# **Internetwork**

A network of networks is called an **internetwork**, or simply the **internet**.
It is the **largest network** on the planet.

The internet connects all WANs and can connect LANs and home networks.

Internet uses:

* **TCP/IP protocol suite**
* **IP addresses** for identification

Most of today’s internet uses **IPv4**, but due to shortage of address space, it is migrating to **IPv6**.

Internet allows users to access and share **huge amounts of information** worldwide using:

# **Ethernet**
Ethernet is the **most common technology** used in a LAN (Local Area Network).
It connects computers through a switch or hub.

### **Important Points:**

* Invented in the 1970s, standard: **IEEE 802.3**
* Ethernet uses shared media → **data collisions can happen**
* To detect collisions, it uses **CSMA/CD**
* Every Ethernet device has a **48-bit MAC address** (unique identity)
* Traditional Ethernet speed → **10 Mbps** (10BASE-T)
* Cables used: **Coaxial or Cat-5 with RJ-45 connector**
* Topology: **Star topology**
* Max cable length: **100 meters**

# **Fast Ethernet**
Fast Ethernet is a **faster version** of normal Ethernet.

### **Important Points:**

* Speed: **100 Mbps**
* Standard: **100BASE-T**
* Works on **Cat-5 cable**
* Wireless Fast Ethernet uses **CSMA/CA**
* Fiber version: **100BASE-FX**
* Fiber cable range:

  * **100 m** (half-duplex)
  * **2000 m** (full-duplex)


# **Gigabit Ethernet**
Gigabit Ethernet is an **even faster** type of Ethernet.

### **Important Points:**

* Speed: **1000 Mbps = 1 Gbps**
* Introduced after 1995
* Uses **Cat-5, Cat-5e, Cat-6 cables**
* Standard: **IEEE 802.3ab**
* Fiber version: **IEEE 802.3ah**

Most modern networks use Gigabit Ethernet because it is very fast.

# **Virtual LAN (VLAN)**
In a normal Ethernet network:

* There is **one broadcast domain** (everyone receives broadcast messages)
* There is **one collision domain**

Switches can separate collision domains,
but **broadcast domain remains the same**.

### **What does VLAN do?**
VLAN divides a single network into **multiple small networks (groups)** inside the same switch.

### **Example:**

In a switch with 10 computers:

* 5 computers → VLAN 10
* 5 computers → VLAN 20

Now:

* Computers in VLAN 10 can talk only to each other
* Computers in VLAN 20 can talk only to each other
* A device in one VLAN **cannot communicate** with another VLAN directly

### **Important:**

* VLAN is a **Layer-2 technology**
* To communicate between two VLANs, a **Router (Layer-3 device)** is required


## **Networking Engineering**
Networking engineering is a complicated task that involves software, firmware, chip-level engineering, hardware, and electric pulses.
To make networking easier, the whole networking concept is divided into **multiple layers**.

Each layer performs a specific task and is independent from other layers.
But almost all networking tasks depend on all layers collectively.
Layers share data with each other and depend on each other to take input and send output.

## **Layered Tasks**
In a layered network model, the whole networking process is divided into **small tasks**.
Each task is assigned to a particular layer, and each layer works **dedicatedly** on its own work.

In layered communication:
* One layer of a device communicates with the **same layer** on another device (peer-to-peer communication).
* The task can start from the top layer or bottom layer.
* If the task starts at the top, it goes down layer by layer.
* If it starts at the bottom, it travels upward.

Each layer has its own protocols, procedures, and functions.
Layers identify their counterparts using **encapsulation headers and tails**.


## **OSI Model**
OSI (Open System Interconnect) model is an **open standard** for all communication systems.
It was developed by the **International Standard Organization (ISO)**.

The OSI model has **seven layers**:

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Presentation Layer**
3. **Session Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Network Layer**
6. **Data Link Layer**
7. **Physical Layer**


### **Application Layer**
Provides interface to the user through protocols that interact directly with applications.

### **Presentation Layer**
Defines how data from the remote host should be presented in the native format.

### **Session Layer**
Maintains communication sessions between hosts.
Example: After login, the session remains active for some time without re-authentication.

### **Transport Layer**
Provides **end-to-end delivery** between hosts.

### **Network Layer**

Responsible for **address assignment** and uniquely identifying hosts in the network.

### **Data Link Layer**
Handles reading and writing data on the physical line. Detects **link-level errors**.

### **Physical Layer**
Defines the hardware, cabling, data pulses, power output, etc.

# **Internet Model (TCP/IP Model)**

Internet uses the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, also called the **Internet Model**.
It has **4 layers** and is used for all communication over the internet.

Unlike OSI, the Internet Model depends on network independence.

Its layers are:

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Transport Layer**
3. **Internet Layer**
4. **Link Layer**

### **Application Layer**
Defines protocols that allow users to interact with the network.
Examples: **FTP, HTTP**

### **Transport Layer**

Defines how data should flow between hosts. Main protocol: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
Ensures:

* Ordered delivery
* Reliable transfer
* End-to-end communication

### **Internet Layer**

Uses **Internet Protocol (IP)** for addressing and routing.
Identifies hosts and finds best path for data.

### **Link Layer**

Handles sending and receiving actual data frames.
Independent of hardware and network architecture.

## **Computer Network Security**

During the initial days of the internet, its use was limited to military and universities for research and development purposes.
Later, when all networks merged together and formed the internet, the data started traveling through public networks.
People began sending highly sensitive data such as bank credentials, usernames and passwords, personal documents, online shopping details, or confidential information.

All security threats are **intentional**, meaning they occur only when triggered on purpose. Security threats can be divided into the following categories:


## **Interruption**

Interruption is a security threat where the **availability** of resources is attacked. For example, a user is unable to access a web server, or the website is hijacked.

## **Privacy Breach**

In this threat, the **privacy of a user is compromised**.
Someone who is not authorized is accessing or intercepting the data sent or received by the genuine user.

## **Integrity**

This threat includes **alteration or modification** of data during communication. The attacker intercepts the data, modifies it, or creates false data and sends it to the receiver.
The receiver receives the data believing it came from the original sender.

## **Authenticity**
This threat occurs when an attacker **pretends to be a genuine user** and accesses resources or communicates with genuine users.

> No technique can provide **100% security**, but steps can be taken to secure data while it travels in an unsecured network.
The most widely used technique is **Cryptography**.

## **Cryptography**
Cryptography is a technique used to **encrypt plain-text data**, making it difficult to understand or interpret.
Several cryptographic algorithms are used today:

* **Secret Key Encryption**
* **Public Key Encryption**
* **Message Digest**

## **Secret Key Encryption**

Both sender and receiver share **one secret key**.
This key is used to encrypt data at the sender's end. After encryption, the data is sent to the receiver.
Because the receiver also has the same secret key, the encrypted data can be easily decrypted.

**Example:**
Data Encryption Standard (DES).
In Secret Key encryption, every host must have a separate key, which makes it difficult to manage.

## **Public Key Encryption**
In this system, every user has **two keys**:

* **Private (Secret) Key** – kept hidden
* **Public Key** – shared publicly

The sender uses the **receiver’s public key** to encrypt data.
The receiver decrypts it using their **own private key**.

**Example:**
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

## **Message Digest**

In this method, actual data is **not sent**.
Instead, a **hash value** of the data is calculated and sent.
The receiver calculates a hash on their side and compares it with the received one.
If both hash values match, the message is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.

**Example:**
MD5 hashing
Widely used in authentication where passwords are compared with stored hash values.

---

## **Computer Network Components**

Computer networks are made of **hardware components** and **software components**.
Both are needed to create a working network at home or in organizations.

* **Hardware components** → server, client, peer, transmission media, connecting devices.
* **Software components** → operating system and network protocols.

## **1. Computer Network Hardware Components**

These are the **physical parts** of the network.

### **Servers**

* High-performance computers that manage network resources.
* Store data, applications, printers, databases, etc.
* Examples: file server, database server, print server.

### **Clients**

* Normal computers that request services from servers.
* Users work on these to access files, apps, printers, etc.

### **Peers**

* Computers that act as both **clients and servers**.
* Used in small peer-to-peer networks.

### **Transmission Media**

* Channels through which data travels in a network.
* Example: **coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, Cat-5/6 cables, microwaves, infrared waves**.
* Can be **guided** (with cable) or **unguided** (wireless).

### **Connecting Devices**

Used to connect computers or networks together.
Examples:

* **Routers**
* **Hubs**
* **Switches**
* **Bridges**
* **Repeaters**
* **Gateways**

## **2. Connecting Devices**

### **Hub**

* A basic device that connects multiple computers.
* Works on **Physical Layer** of OSI Model.
* Broadcasts data to all devices → causes collisions.

### **Switch**

* Advanced version of a hub.
* Sends data to the **correct device only**, not all.
* Reduces collisions.
* Commonly used in **LANs**.

### **Bridge**

* Connects two network segments.
* Reduces traffic.
* Works on **Data Link Layer**.

### **Router**

* Works on **Network Layer**.
* Can assign IP addresses and perform security filtering & QoS.

### **Gateway**

* Connects two networks having **different protocols**.
* Can work on multiple OSI layers.
* Converts data formats.

### **Repeater**

* Boosts weak signals and regenerates them.

## **3. Computer Network Software Components**

These are the programs and rules used to operate the network.

### **Networking Operating System**

* Installed on servers.
* Helps users share files, databases, applications, printers, etc.
* Examples: Windows Server, Linux Server.

### **Protocol Suite**

A protocol is a **set of rules** for communication.
Protocols ensure that all computers follow the same method to send/receive data.

Two main protocol suites:

### a) **OSI Model (Open System Interconnection)**

* A 7-layer standard model used for understanding networking.

### b) **TCP/IP Model**

* A 4-layer model used by the **Internet**.
* Practical and widely used for real networks.

# **What are Connectors?**

Connectors are devices used to **connect network cables** to computers and network devices like PCs, hubs, switches, servers, and workstations.

They connect the **guided (wired)** transmission media to the device.

Connectors have two types:

* **Male connectors** → plugs
* **Female connectors** → ports/sockets

## **Types of Connectors**

There are several types of connectors used in networking:

# **1. Twisted Pair Cable Connectors**

Most modern networks use twisted pair cabling (UTP or STP).

* **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** is more common because it is cheaper and easy to install.

# **Gateways in Computer Networks**

A **gateway** is a network device that connects **two different networks** that use **different transmission protocols**.

It acts like a **bridge** between two networks that cannot communicate directly.

* The most common type of gateway works at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
* But depending on the function, a gateway can operate at **any layer** of the OSI model.

A gateway is the **entry and exit point** of a network.
All traffic going outside the LAN must pass through the gateway. Internal LAN traffic does NOT pass through it.

# **Features of Gateways**

* Located at the **boundary of a network** and manages incoming and outgoing data
* Connects **two networks with different protocols**
* Works as a **protocol converter** to make both networks compatible
* Can operate on **any OSI layer**
* Stores routing information and helps in path selection
* Can work as a **proxy server** or **firewall** in enterprise networks
* Usually implemented as a device with **multiple NICs (Network Interface Cards)**
* Can also be created using **software**
* Uses **packet switching** to transmit data


# **Types of Gateways**

## **1. Unidirectional Gateway**

* Data flows in **only one direction**
* Changes made at the source are copied to the destination
* Destination cannot send back changes
* Used in **data archiving** and backup systems

## **2. Bidirectional Gateway**

* Data flows in **both directions**
* Used for **synchronization** tasks

# **Types of Gateways**

## **1. Network Gateway**

* Most commonly used gateway
* Connects two networks with different protocols
* If someone says “gateway” without specifying, this is usually what they mean

## **2. Cloud Storage Gateway**

* Connects private storage systems to cloud storage
* Translates cloud APIs like **SOAP** or **REST**
* Helps add private storage to cloud applications without moving all data to the cloud

## **3. Internet-To-Orbit Gateway (I2O)**

* Connects internet devices to satellites or spacecraft systems
* Used in scientific missions
* Examples: Project HERMES, GENSO

## **4. IoT Gateway**

* Connects **IoT devices** (sensors, smart devices) to cloud servers
* Translates sensor data into formats cloud systems can understand
* Provides connectivity between IoT networks and applications

## **5. VoIP Trunk Gateway**

* Connects traditional telephone systems to VoIP networks
* Used to send voice signals over the internet
* Converts analog phone signals into digital VoIP signals
